# 10 day coding challenge with Python
These are my solutions for the 10 day winter-break coding challenge. Event link: https://www.facebook.com/events/843253696243420?active_tab=about
Each day there was a problem to solve. The idea of the challenge is to learn something new and adapt the problem to own programming skills. 

## 📖 Table of contents:
  • [Day 1: Palindromes, web scraping] (#Day 1: Palindromes, web scraping)
  
  • [Day 2: API, openpyxl] (#Day 2: API, openpyxl)
  
  • [Day 3: Automatic email sending] (#Day 3: Automatic email sending)

## 🧐 Day 1: Palindromes, web scraping
  ❗ Requirements (from prompt):
  
  1) Check if an inputted word is a palindrome, display adequate message.
  
  2) Run a webpage that displays anagrams of an inputted word.
  
  ↗️ My extension:
  
  ad 2) Use selenium library to web scrape in search for data which I display in the terminal.
  
  🧠 Learned today: 
  
  •  web scraping basics, finding specific tags and classes on a page
  
  •  selenium library for Python

## ⛅ Day 2: API, openpyxl
  ❗ Requirements (from prompt):
  
  1) Display date, time, day of the week, temperature in a given city. Use https://rapidapi.com/commu.../api/open-weather-map/endpoints

  2) Display a random quote https://type.fit/api/quotes

  3) Use datetime and request libraries

  
  ↗️ My extensions:
  
  Create a calendar card in excel with data from the weather API.
  
  Error messages for requests with error codes other than 200.
  
  🧠 Learned today: 
  
  •  a few useful options for editing spreadsheet (merging, coloring cells, changing font, style)
  
  •  method for calculations on dates (timedelta), strftime for date formatting

## 📧 Day 3: Automatic email sending

 ❗ Requirements (from prompt):
  
  1) Send emails to people from a mailing list (in csv or xls), with a message and an image

  2) Secure program for edge cases (no image file, no mailing list etc.)

  
  ↗️ My extensions:
  
  I used a function for getting random quotes from API (from Day 2) as a message content.
  
  I used bing_image_downloader to download an image that represents the quote.  
  
  🧠 Learned today: 
  
  •  smtplib for sending emails
